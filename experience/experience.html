     <h2 class="border-goals">Objective</h2>
     <p>I am seeking a position in a company in which i can repeat the same daily tasks, become invisible to my wo-workers, and maintain a dull, predictable, safe life without any chance of exitement. I consider myself a go-getter, whatever the heck that means, and will be a great asset to any company. I excel in skills related to whatever position it is I'm applying at and look forward to pretending to have enthusiasm for your company.</p>
     <h3>Skills Summary</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Ten years experience taking orders from a supervisor I cant't stand.</li>
       <li>Exceptional computer knowledge with focus on dealing with stupid customers that have no idea what they are talking about.</li>
       <li>Four years supervisory experience, and by supervisor I mean one time i was responsible for turning the lights out at Burger King.</li>
       <li>I also know a bunch of things related to the job I'm applying but chances are I listed everything you'd have no idea what I'm talking about because you work in the Human resources department.</li>
       <li>Works well with others, works well alone. According to the honesty test I took earlier this is a paradox and therefore I am a lieing scumbag who plans on stealing everything from you.</li>
       <li>I'm very skilled at pretending to be nice to people. I can use the word<q>company policy</q> upwards of three times per sentence.</li>
       <li>Willing to pretend to be a christian/republican while at the workplace as needed.</li>
       <li>Will promise to never use the bathroom while at work because I know how much that cuts into <q>company time</q></li>
